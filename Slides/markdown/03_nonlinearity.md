## Why This Matters

Real biological and clinical effects are **rarely linear**.

Examples:
- dose–response curves.
- saturation and thresholds.
- diminishing returns.
- nonlinear gene/protein interactions.


---

## Key Idea: Add Nonlinear Features

We keep using a **linear model**, but expand the input features:

### Polynomial Features
- $x^2$, $x^3$.
- interactions ($x_1x_1, x_1^2, x_2, ...$).
- allows curvature and richer patterns.

This is still simple, interpretable, fast.

## For Further Learning

**Sparse Identification of nonlinear dynamical systems:**
- Discovered dynamics of fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle
- Input many nonlinear features to the model, used L1 to select the relevant features.
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03580](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03580)

**Spline Regression:**
- More flexible non-linear regression to fit complex curves

---

## Workflow You’ll Use 

1. Load the drug response dataset.
2. Fit a **baseline linear model**.
3. Add polynomial features (degree=???).
4. Compare model performance.
5. Visualize:
  - data vs linear fit.
  - data vs polynomial fit.

## What to Look For

- Do non-linear functions of $x$ improve MAE?
- Does the polynomial model better follow the data trend?
- Is the relationship between top predictor + effect nonlinear?
- When does added flexibility risk overfitting?
